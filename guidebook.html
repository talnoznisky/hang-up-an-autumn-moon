I almost forgot
To hang up an autumn moon
    Over the mountain.
- Richard Wright
        </p>
        <p>
            hang-up-an-autumn moon is an oracular CLI based on the late haiku of Richard Wright.
            This is the 'webapp' version of it.

            <strong>Methodology:</strong>
            <br>
            When summoned, the oracle randomly selects three haiku from an internal corpus 
            of haiku by Richard Wright. Then the oracle creates a little doodle of each haiku
            by passing segment of the text to an algorithmic art generator. The querent gets
            a three-card spread of the doodles and must select one. The oracle returns the card's
            full haiku and a judgment to help frame the querent's insight into the haiku. 
        </p>

            <strong>Source material:</strong>
            <br>
            The oracle is based on a corpus of haiku by Richard Wright. Each haiku is attributed
            with a mode, either sparrow or hyperdrive, and a pair of judgments. The modes are 
            similar to the major and minor arcana of the Tarot. Sparrow cards represent 
            higher-order considerations and are actually all about sparrows. Hyperdrive cards 
            speak to day-by-day concerns and their haikus tend to describe the intensification
            of one natural element by another. The judgments also vary by mode: sparrow cards
            offer single subjective nouns for framing the haiku; hyperdrive cards offer very
            brief imperatives to help the querent ideate a course of action.
