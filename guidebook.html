    I almost forgot
To hang up an autumn moon
    Over the mountain.
- Richard Wright

hang-up-an-autumn moon is an oracular CLI based on the late haiku of Richard Wright.
This is the 'webapp' version of it.

Methodology:
When summoned, the oracle randomly selects three haiku from an internal corpus 
of haiku by Richard Wright. Then the oracle creates a little doodle of each haiku
by passing segment of the text to an algorithmic art generator. The querent gets
a three-card spread of the doodles and must select one. The oracle returns the card's
full haiku and a judgment to help frame the querent's insight into the haiku. 

Source material:
The oracle is based on a corpus of haiku by Richard Wright. Each haiku is attributed
with a mode, either sparrow or hyperdrive, and a pair of judgments. The modes are 
similar to the major and minor arcana of the Tarot. Sparrow cards represent 
higher-order considerations and are actually all about sparrows. Hyperdrive cards 
speak to day-by-day concerns and their haikus tend to describe the intensification
of one natural element by another. The judgments also vary by mode: sparrow cards
offer single subjective nouns for framing the haiku; hyperdrive cards offer very
brief imperatives to help the querent ideate a course of action.
