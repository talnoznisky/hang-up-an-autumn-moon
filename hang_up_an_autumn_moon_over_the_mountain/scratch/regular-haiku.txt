103
Just enough rain
To bring the smell of silk
From the umbrellas

201
Over spring mountains
A star ends the paragraph 
Of a thunderstorm

240
In a red sunset
A frog command the night wind
To roll out a moon.

242
The darting fireflies
Are dragging the river
To where the sun went down

277
The chill autumn dusk
Grows colder as yellow lights
Come on in skyscrapers

299
A descending fog
Is making an autumn day
Taste of buried years

321
The ocean's soft sound
Lifts the toll of a far bell
To the half-seen stars

339
A cathedral bell 
Dimming the river water
In the autumn dusk

547
A layer of snow
Is pulling the mountains nearer
Making them smaller

548
One caw of a crow
Tints all of the fallen leaves
A deeper yellow

554
The summer rainstorm 
Drenches chickens in the field
Making them smaller

604
Departing wild geese
Are the fanning the moon brighter
With their tireless wings.
