14
I grant to the sparrows
The telegraph wires that brought
Me such good tidings!

communication, good tidings, messengers representatives of one's fortunes


16
All right, You Sparrows;
The sun has set and you can now
Stop your chattering!

18
Sparrow's excrement 
Becomes quickly powdery
On sizzling pavements.

contents of messages, fortunes dry up in intense times
extremes burn through our fortune
the path is hot

53
A sparrow feather
On a barb of rusty wire
In the sizzling heat.

67
The day is so long
That even noisy sparrows
Fall strangely silent.

118
For some strange reason
Sparrows are congregating
In an old rose bush.

142
A wounded sparrow
Sinks in clear cold lake water,
Its eyes still open.

you are drowning in an excessive of reflectiveness. it would be ok to avert your gaze, to find a different perspective.

in short, stop being so hard on yourself

190
Even the sparrows
Are attempting to thaw out
The frozen scarecrow.



216
The trilling sparrows
Sound as if they too had got
A letter today.

293
As the bank teller
Jiggles a stack of silver
I think of sparrows.

317
Shrilling sparrows
Are sheathing the waterfall
With glittering light.

568
It is not outdoors
That the baby sparrow cheeps
But here in the house!

576 
Calling and calling
The faint voice of a sparrow
From the autumn rain

582
A limping sparrow
Leaves on a white window sill
Lacy tracks of blood

667
That sparrow bent down,
Its head tucked beneath its wing-- 
Sewing a button?

686
A darting sparrow
Startles the skinny scarecrow
Back to watchfulness

705
On a scarecrow's head
A sparrow braces itself
Against the spring wind

727
Hopping on a fence 
A sparrow casts its shadow
On a horse's flank

730
From the cherry tree
To the roof of the red barn
A cloud of sparrows flew.

734
A magnolia 
Fell amid fighting sparrows
Putting them to flight.

792
Does the sparrow know
That it is upon my roof
The he is hopping?
