    On a scarecrow's head
A sparrow braces itself
    Against the spring wind

['Spontaneity', 'Safety']

730
    From the cherry tree
To the roof of the red barn
    A cloud of sparrows flew.

['Manifestation', 'Distraction']

734
    A magnolia 
Fell amid fighting sparrows
    Putting them to flight.

['Excitement', 'Vulnerability']

    Does the sparrow know
That it is upon my roof
    That he is hopping?

['Passivity', 'Guilt']

    It is not outdoors
That the baby sparrow cheeps
    But here in the house!

['Suspicion', 'Delight']

16
    All right, You Sparrows;
The sun has set and you can now
    Stop your chattering!

['Exhaustion', 'Renewal']

67
    The day is so long
That even noisy sparrows
    Fall strangely silent.

['Conciliation', 'Caution']

    For some strange reason
Sparrows are congregating
    In an old rose bush.

Are sheathing the waterfall
    With glittering light.

    I slept so long and sound
But I did not know why until
    I saw the snow outside

['Plan something', 'Rest first']

201
    Over spring mountains
A star ends the paragraph 
    Of a thunderstorm

['Make peace', 'Measure change']

253
    From a tenement
The blue jazz of a trumpet
    Weaving autumn mists

['Live seasonally', 'Combine sensitivities']

277
    The chill autumn dusk
Grows colder as yellow lights
    Come on in skyscrapers

['Leave work', 'Accept dimishment']

321
    The ocean's soft sound
Lifts the toll of a far bell
    To the half-seen stars.

['Contain excitement', 'Gaze widely']

339 
    A cathedral bell
Dimming the river water
    In the autumn dusk.

['Reappraise constants', 'Leave soon']

547
    A layer of snow
Is pulling the mountains nearer
    Making them smaller.

['Tighten boundaries', 'Lead intimacy']

548
    One caw of a crow
Tints all of the fallen leaves
    A deeper yellow.

['Dress different', 'Look back']

554
    The summer rainstorm 
Drenches chickens in the field
    Making them smaller.

['Absorb influences', 'Accept less']

609
    Departing wild geese
Are fanning the moon brighter
    With their tireless wings.

['Invent holidays', 'Never quit']

635
    An empty seashore:
Taking a long summer with it,
    A departing train.

['Leave alone', 'Create attachments']    

556
    The big light in the fog
Was but a little lantern
    When we came to it.

['Confront honesty', 'Characterize spaces']

648
    I am positive
That this is the same spring wind
    That I felt yesterday.

['Doubt hype', 'Recognize renewals']
